# Answer Sheet Checker

## Overview  
This project automates the process of checking student answer sheets. It extracts both multiple-choice answers and handwritten text from scanned bubble sheets.

### Key Features  
- **Bubble Sheet Processing:** Uses OpenCV for image preprocessing and extracting answers from bubbled options.  
- **Handwritten Text Recognition:** Leverages Tesseract OCR to read handwritten answers and student names.  
- **Excel Output:** Processes and stores the extracted data in a structured Excel file for further analysis.  

### Challenges  
This project was both challenging and rewarding, involving:  
- Precise image preprocessing to handle variations in scanned sheets.  
- Integrating OCR for accurate handwritten text extraction.  
- Ensuring high accuracy for both bubble and text recognition.  

### Tools and Technologies  
- **OpenCV:** Image preprocessing and bubble detection.  
- **Pytesseract:** Optical character recognition for handwritten text.  
- **Python:** Overall project implementation and data processing.
